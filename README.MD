# Aya Shameimaru Project.
This is a mod for Slay the Spire. It intends to faithfully add Aya from the Touhou Project into the game.

# Mechanics [Photographs]

Photograph cards are prevalent in Aya's cardpool. A photograph card is a card that is generated via the "Snapshot" keyword. They can be generated upgraded if the keyword says "Snapshot+", and they can be upgraded an infinite amount of times.

Photographs take the form of whatever action the enemy was doing that turn. For example, if an enemy was attacking for 15 damage, the photograph would have the property of "Deal 15 damage.". If the enemy was dealing 7 damage 2 times, the card would "Deal 7 damage 2 times". And so on.

Of course, photographs also copy other enemy actions. For example, on cultist's buff turn, your Photograph would read "Gain 3 Ritual." There are a few exceptions to this, where the boss cannot do anything mimickable by the player (Slime boss split, for example), or actions which would negatively hurt the player regardless (Chosen's hex works against the player regardless of who it is applied to.) In these scenarios, Photographs simply draw a card instead.

# Mechanics [Evasion]

Evasion, and it's active counterpart Evasive, are gained as the player draws cards. It is meant to thematically resemble high speed, and reward the player for constantly going through their deck.

Evasion is a simple resource, and is what is gained, as mentioned. When 25 Evasion is gained, 1 Evasive is gained, which prevents ALL damage that turn. (Thematically, you were so fast drawing, the enemies can't keep up with you, and thus hit you. Plus, Aya is "The fastest in Gensokyo.")

This way of generating Evasion, is often tied to discard synergy, which further boosts your draws, gains you resources, and has some fun one off effects. Alternatively, some of the cards thin the deck, letting you loop, and loop your draw engine back again. This draw/discard synergy is also expanded on in powers, inside of Aya's draft.

# Mechanics [Adaptive]

The final mechanic of this character is the keyword Adaptive. It doesn't appear on very many cards in the draft. It's supposed to reflect how a journalist can keep on their toes, answer questions, acknowledge the responses of the target they're interviewing, and continue the conversation. Thematically, a lot of the Adaptive cards are based around the "mood", of the target, so for example, some options will anger the target, some will calm them down.
At first, it may seem counterintuitive to pick the Adaptive options that help the enemies, but this increase in enemy strength helps Aya's game-plan and can swing combats in her favour.

To continue on with this theme of a journalist being adaptive, there are a lot of cards that can sway the monster's opinion, and thus what they will do. These don't have the Adaptive keyword, and are instead revolving around changing the intent of the target creature to benefit Aya's game plan. For example, if Aya is evasive, it would be beneficial to make the enemy attack her, as she will take no damage.

# Aya's Game Plan.

And this, is how Aya's game plan comes together. Photographs give Aya an adaptive playstyle, reacting even more so than basegame characters to enemy actions.
Adaptive cards give a branch in playstyle, as the player can weaken the enemies to easily block, or enhance them to gain stronger Photographs, at a potential price of taking more damage.
Intent changers and Evasive let the player command what the enemy does, to benefit them, evasive especially so, as it gives the player turns to build up strong attacks in the form of the photographs.
That, combined with a strong draw engine coupled with a discard archetype, let the player gain the answers they want to tackle the situation ahead.

# Inspiration.

I'm always fascinated with interesting decks in CCG's. Not the general optimized, meta decks that dominate formats, but the rogue decks, and the decks that counter the meta decks in surprising ways.
My favourite category of these decks are "Toolbox", or "Checkmate" decks, which create a deck running counters to popular cards in the format, and win by alternative winconditions by reacting to the opponent.
An example of this was from when I competitvely played the pokemon TCG, was a [Naganadel GX, Cinccino Checkmate deck.][cinc]. 

Aya's playstyle and inspiration came from my love for the playstyle of these deck styles, and I wanted to emulate something similar in this mod.
